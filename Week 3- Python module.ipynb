    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, an object could represent a person with properties like a dog's name, age, and owner's name and behaviors such as walking, barking , breathing, and running. Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming, which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, that flow sequentially in order to complete a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well."

    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say you want to track employees in an organization. You need to store some basic information about each employee, such as their name, age, position, and the year they started working.\n",

    "\n",
    "Classes are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions called methods, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data. In this week, we’ll create a Dog class that stores some information about the characteristics and behaviors that an individual dog can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined. It doesn’t actually contain any data. The Dog class specifies that a name and an age are necessary for defining a dog, but it doesn’t contain the name or age of any specific dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the class is the blueprint, an instance is an object that is built from a class and contains real data. An instance of the Dog class is not a blueprint anymore. It’s an actual dog with a name, like Miles, who’s four years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, a class is like a form or questionnaire. An instance is like a form that has been filled out with information. Just like many people can fill out the same form with their own unique information, many instances can be created from a single class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminologies in class:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class** − A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class variable** − A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data member** − A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function overloading** − The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance variable** − A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** − The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance** − An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instantiation** − The creation of an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method** − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object** − A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.\n",
